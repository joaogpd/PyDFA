# PyDFA
This module provides a Python class for evaluating whether a given string belongs to a Deterministic Finite Automata's language.
It provides a constructor for representing one such DFA, as well as a method that takes in a string and outputs whether it belongs or 
not to the language, and an extension of this method that takes in a list of strings and evaluates each of them, one by one. A function
for showing the contents of the created automaton is also provided.
